# Face Image Inpainting with GANs

This project focuses on **face image inpainting** using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal is to restore missing or occluded parts of face images by leveraging deep learning techniques, providing realistic and coherent reconstructions.

## Features

- **High-quality face image inpainting** using GANs.
- **Training on face datasets for improved accuracy.**
- **Handles large occlusions and missing regions.**
- **Pre-trained model support for quick inference.**

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:**
  - PyTorch
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy

## Example Usage

- **Input:** Face image with missing parts.
- **Output:** Reconstructed face image with inpainted areas.

## Potential Improvements

- Improve model accuracy with larger and more diverse datasets.
- Implement real-time inference capabilities.
- Deploy the model as an online web service.
